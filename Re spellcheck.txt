Hi Rob!

Thanks for the encouragement but the code is pretty crappy.  Slap an MIT licence on it in and 
attribute it to me in case you want to use it for something. :-)

Cheers!

Mikael,
 
I came across your version of Peter Norvig’s Spell Corrector at 
https://github.com/mikaelj/snippets/blob/master/lisp/spellcheck/spellcheck.lisp 
 
It’s pretty useful and I’d like to try to get it added to the Quicklisp repository please.
 
I wonder whether you would be kind enough to confirm your copyright assignment and license 
terms please.
 
I have experimented with packaging it as an ASDF installable library at 
https://github.com/RobBlackwell/spellcheck 
 
I respectfully ask for you permission to use your code in this way. Of course if you would rather 
have the master and submit to Quicklisp yourself, then please feel free to take any or all of my 
suggested modifications as you wish.
 
Thank you for your time,
 
Rob Blackwell.
 
Hobbyist Lisper.
